/*how does declaring the `lib` object at the begining of the library function, allow it to have methods appended to it 
in the form of `lib.settings = {...};` (assumption) why doesn't it need to be apended to either 1) a parameter of the main function, 
or 2)be declared as a new function
the formatMoney(); method is written as a variable and not simply appended as another object
this could be because it is not meerly a list of parameters 
   to be adjusted as a reference to how the rest of the methods actually interact with numbers
while .formatMoney(); is actaully processing numbers anf returning output

with formatMoney();
how does declaring a variable, and immediately assigning it to a method on the lib{} object, and then immediately afterwards defining a function on it

create something to test columns

test each settings option
